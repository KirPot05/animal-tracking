# WD-03 Animal Tracking System - Group Management and Alerts

## Introduction

Welcome to the Animal Tracking System repository! This project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for tracking animal movements, managing groups, and generating alerts for group dynamics using real-time location data. The system uses Node.js for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and React Native for the frontend, integrating Google Maps for visualizing animal locations.

## Problem Being Faced

In wildlife conservation and animal husbandry, monitoring the movements and behaviors of animals is crucial. However, tracking these animals and understanding their interactions in real-time poses significant challenges. Without efficient tracking and alert systems, managing large herds or endangered species can become overwhelming, leading to issues such as:

- **Loss of animals:** Difficulty in locating animals that have strayed from the group.
- **Health monitoring:** Challenges in identifying animals that might be injured or sick.
- **Behavioral studies:** Inability to monitor group dynamics and social interactions effectively.
- **Resource management:** Inefficiencies in managing resources for conservation or farming.

## Need for Tracking Animals

Effective animal tracking is essential for several reasons:

- **Conservation Efforts:** Helps in protecting endangered species by monitoring their movements and identifying potential threats.
- **Farm Management:** Enhances the management of livestock, ensuring their well-being and optimizing resource allocation.
- **Research:** Facilitates the study of animal behaviors, social structures, and migration patterns.
- **Safety:** Improves safety by providing real-time alerts when animals stray into dangerous areas or away from their group.

## Solution

Our Animal Tracking System provides a robust and scalable solution to these challenges:

- **Real-time Tracking:** Receive and process animal location data every 5 seconds.
- **Group Management:** Implement a grouping algorithm to assign animals to groups based on their proximity, with a configurable radius.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Generate notifications when animals leave their groups, helping in timely intervention.
- **Visualization:** Providing an user-friendly map interface to display animal locations and group boundaries in real-time.

### Key Features

1. **Backend:**

   - API to receive and process animal location data.
   - Store animal data and location history in MongoDB.
   - Implement a simple but effective grouping algorithm.

2. **Frontend:**

   - Display a map showing real-time animal locations and group boundaries.
   - Allow configuration of grouping radius.
   - Show notifications for animals leaving their groups.

3. **Real-time Updates:**
   - Use WebSockets for real-time data processing and updates.

### Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Flask
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo
- **Maps:** Google Maps API
- **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets (optional)
- **Notification and Alerts**: Push Notifications for alerts
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes

## Industries That Could Benefit

This system can be highly beneficial across various industries:
